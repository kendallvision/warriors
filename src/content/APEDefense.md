## **A.P.E. Defense**

A.P.E. Defense (Awareness, Prevention, Execution) trains non-martial artists to defend themselves and to provide a framework for certification on presenting the materials on behalf of Warriors for Christ, Inc.

Attendees are taught defense-minded principles and practical techniques they can use without studying a full course on martial arts. They will use easy fine motor skills they use each day such as turning a key in the car ignition.

These courses are generally 1-2 hours and are offered free of charge.
